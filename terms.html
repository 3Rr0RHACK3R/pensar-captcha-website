            Last Updated: July 13, 2025 (Because even legal stuff needs a glow-up sometimes)

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-400 mb-4">1. Your Agreement (Don't Skip This, Seriously)</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">
                By downloading, installing, or using "PensarIMAGE" (hereinafter referred to as "the App" or "this digital masterpiece"), you, the user (hereinafter referred to as "you," "your," or "the magnificent imbecile"), agree to be bound by these Terms of Service. If you don't agree, then, like, don't use the App. Simple as that. We're not tryna catch a vibe with legal drama.
            </p>
            <p>
                This App is designed for local use on your personal computer. It does not connect to any cloud services for storing your sensitive data. Your data stays with you, because we respect your digital privacy (and frankly, we're too lazy to build a whole cloud infrastructure for this free tier project, lol).
            </p>

        <section class="mb-8">
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-400 mb-4">2. User Accounts (Your Own Digital Pad)</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">
                To use the App, you'll create a local user account. This account is stored on your computer, along with your hashed password and your TOTP secret keys.
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 text-gray-300">
                <li>You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password. Don't write it on a sticky note. Don't tell your dog. Just keep it secret, keep it safe.</li>
                <li>You are responsible for all activities that occur under your account. If your cat somehow logs in and deletes all your accounts, that's on you (and your cat).</li>
                <li>You must be at least 13 years old to use this App. If you're younger, go ask your parents for permission to use their authenticator.</li>
            </ul>

        <section class="mb-8">
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-400 mb-4">3. Acceptable Use (Don't Be a Menace)</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">
                You agree not to use the App for any purpose that is unlawful or prohibited by these Terms. Basically, don't do anything sus.
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 text-gray-300">
                <li>Don't try to hack the App. It's open source, you can literally see the code. Just fork it if you want to mess with it.</li>
                <li>Don't use it for anything illegal. We're not your alibi.</li>
                <li>Don't distribute malware or viruses through the App. That's just rude.</li>
                <li>Don't pretend to be someone else. Unless it's for a cosplay. Then maybe.</li>
            </ul>

        <section class="mb-8">
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-400 mb-4">4. Intellectual Property (It's Our Vibe, Not Yours)</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">
                The App and its original content, features, and functionality are and will remain the exclusive property of "PensarIMAGE" (or whoever you decide owns it, you're the developer, imbecile!). This includes all the snazzy code, the slick UI, and even these witty legal terms.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can use it, modify it (it's Python, duh!), and share it, but don't try to claim you invented the wheel here. Give credit where credit is due, or we'll send our digital ninjas after you (just kidding, mostly).
            </p>
        </section>

        <section class="mb-8">
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-400 mb-4">5. Disclaimer of Warranties (We're Not Perfect, But Who Is?)</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">
                THE APP IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS. WE MAKE NO WARRANTIES, EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, REGARDING THE APP'S RELIABILITY, ACCURACY, OR LACK OF BUGS. WE'RE DOING OUR BEST, OKAY?!
            </p>
            <p>
                We don't guarantee that the App will always be available, uninterrupted, secure, or error-free. The internet is a wild place, and sometimes things just break. It's life.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section class="mb-8">
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-400 mb-4">6. Limitation of Liability (Don't Sue Us, Please)</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">
                IN NO EVENT SHALL "PENSARIMAGE" (OR ITS CREATORS, WHICH IS YOU, YOU IMBECILE!) BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOSS OF PROFITS, DATA, USE, GOODWILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, RESULTING FROM (I) YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF OR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE THE APP; (II) ANY CONDUCT OR CONTENT OF ANY THIRD PARTY ON THE APP; (III) ANY CONTENT OBTAINED FROM THE APP; AND (IV) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, USE, OR ALTERATION OF YOUR TRANSMISSIONS OR CONTENT, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER OR NOT WE HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.
            </p>
            <p>
                Basically, if your life falls apart because this app glitched for a millisecond, don't blame us. We're just providing the tools, not guaranteeing world peace.

        <section class="mb-8">
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-400 mb-4">7. Termination (It's Not You, It's Us... or Maybe It's You)</h2>
            <p>
                We may terminate or suspend your access to the App immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation if you breach the Terms. Just kidding, since it's local, we can't actually "terminate your access." You'd have to delete it yourself. But if you do something really wild, we might just judge you silently.
            </p>

        <section class="mb-8">
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-400 mb-4">8. Governing Law (The Rules of the Game)</h2>
            <p>
                These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of [Your Jurisdiction Here, e.g., "the State of California, USA"], without regard to its conflict of law provisions. Any disputes will be settled in a digital arena, probably involving memes.

        <section class="mb-8">
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-400 mb-4">9. Changes to These Terms (We'll Try to Be Chill About It)</h2>
            <p>
                We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a revision is material, we will try to provide at least 30 days' notice prior to any new terms taking effect. What constitutes a "material change" will be determined at our sole discretion. Basically, we'll try to let you know if we change something big, but no promises. You're responsible for checking this page, you diligent digital citizen!
