                <p><strong>Effective Date: June 29, 2025</strong></p>

                <p>This License Agreement (the "License") governs your use of the Pensar Captcha software (the "Software"), developed by [Your Name/Company Name, e.g., "The Imbecile Corporation"]. By downloading, installing, or using the Software, you irrevocably agree to be bound by the terms of this License. If you do not agree, do not download, install, or use the Software. Your use constitutes absolute acceptance.</p>

                <h3>1. Grant of License - Unrestricted Use (within terms)</h3>
                <p>Subject to the explicit terms and conditions of this License, The Imbecile Corporation hereby grants you a worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual, non-exclusive, non-transferable, and revocable license to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>(a) **Download and install** the Software on any number of computers, without limitation.</li>
                    <li>(b) **Use** the Software for any personal, commercial, governmental, or non-profit purpose whatsoever.</li>
                    <li>(c) **Modify** the Software in any way, shape, or form, for your own internal use or for distribution (subject to Clause 2.e).</li>
                    <li>(d) **Distribute** unmodified copies of the Software (including its full source code) to others, provided that all original copyright notices and this License (or a functionally equivalent, compatible license) remain intact and are conspicuously displayed.</li>
                    <li>(e) **Integrate** the Software's functionality (specifically, the generated client-side snippet and its API interactions) into your own websites and applications, whether free or commercial.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>2. Restrictions - Limits of Freedom (for your protection!)</h3>
                <p>You unequivocally agree not to, and you will not permit any third party to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>(a) Use the Software for any **unlawful, unethical, or malicious purpose**, or in any way that violates applicable laws or regulations. This includes, but is not limited to, creating or distributing malware, spam, or engaging in any form of cybercrime.</li>
                    <li>(b) Use the Software to **create, distribute, or promote automated bots, malicious software, or activities** that undermine internet security, privacy, or legitimate user experiences. This software is for defense, not offense!</li>
                    <li>(c) **Remove, alter, or obscure** any copyright, trademark, or other proprietary rights notices from the Software or its documentation.</li>
                    <li>(d) **Falsely represent** the Software as your own original creation or imply any official affiliation with The Imbecile Corporation without explicit written consent. Your use of Pensar Captcha **does NOT imply endorsement, partnership, or affiliation** with The Imbecile Corporation.</li>
                    <li>(e) **Sell or directly sublicense** the Software as a standalone product. However, you may bundle it within your own larger, distinct commercial applications where Pensar Captcha serves as a component, and not the primary product being marketed or sold independently.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>3. Disclaimer of Warranty - THE "AS IS" TRUTH (Read this carefully, even you, Imbecile!)</h3>

                <h3>5. Termination - The End Game</h3>
